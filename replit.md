# Replit.md - Svenska ITSL Kravanalysverktyg

## Overview

This is a Swedish requirements analysis tool (Kravanalysverktyg) developed for ITSL Solutions AB. The application is designed to import, analyze, filter, and manage procurement requirements from Excel files. It features AI-powered requirement grouping using language models to identify similar requirements across different procurement documents, making it easier to track common requirements across multiple organizations and tenders.

The system provides three main views: Import (for uploading new Excel files with AI-based comparison), Requirements compilation (aggregated requirement lists with configurable category ordering), and Comparison (loading new requirement files to compare against the existing database showing requirement frequency across procurements).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

- **Schema Features**: 
  - Requirements table with text analysis fields (occurrences, categories, organizations)
  - Support for requirement types (must/should requirements)
  - AI grouping fields (group_id, group_representative, similarity_score)
  - User interaction tracking (comments, status, historical data)
  - Import metadata (organization, dates, procurement tracking)
  - Category mappings table for standardizing category names across imports

### AI Integration
- **Service**: OpenAI integration using GPT-5 for requirement analysis and grouping
- **Functionality**: Automated similarity detection between requirements across different Excel imports
- **Batching**: Smart batch processing to handle large requirement sets while respecting API limits
- **Consolidation**: Cross-batch group consolidation for comprehensive requirement matching

### Design System
- **Theme**: Material Design principles optimized for enterprise productivity
